# Number Guessing Game

This Python script is a simple yet engaging game where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range and limited attempts. The game allows players to choose the difficulty level, which in turn dictates the number of attempts they have to guess the number correctly.

Features

Difficulty Levels: Players can choose between 'easy' and 'hard' difficulty levels, affecting the number of attempts they have to guess the number.
Interactive Prompts: The game uses interactive prompts to guide the player through each step, providing feedback on whether their guess was too high or too low.
End Game Scenarios: The game informs the player if they've successfully guessed the number or if they've run out of attempts, providing the correct number in the latter case.

How to Play

Start the game, and you will be greeted with a welcome message along with instructions.
Choose your difficulty level by typing 'easy' or 'hard'. 'Easy' gives you 10 attempts, and 'hard' gives you 5 attempts.
The game will then randomly generate a number between 1 and 100, which you have to guess.
Enter your guess when prompted. The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Continue guessing until you find the right number or run out of attempts.
